# Contents of this Workshop

## [Getting Started](0-Getting-Started/README.md)

In this section we cover everything you need to get started with Rust. We will
set up the development environment. Ideally complete this prior to the workshop.
Also if you have this set up please skip this section.

## [Reading the Token](1-Reading-Token/README.md)

In this section we will start the project by reading the authentication token in
from a file. We will be introduced to working with the standard library.

## [Performing a Web Request](2-Performing-Web-Request/README.md)

In this section our goal is to be able to successfully hit the Github API. In
doing so we will learn about dependencies (crates).
