# Web Client Tutorial

This is a small tutorial where we will build a very simple and specific web
client as a vehicle for familiarizing with using Rust. I will endeavour to make
it as simple to follow through on your own but the initial usage for this is for
a workshop style setting.

## Intended Audience

This workshop is intended for those with software background but no experience
with [Rust] programming language.

## Outcome

The intended outcome of this workshop is to be able to produce a basic web
client that allows you to check pull requests you have open on Github. Through
this I am hoping to expose you to many of the common practices in Rust through
some practical means rather than theory based. I have chosen a very specific
functionality for this client but of course this can be extended and is not a
design I would recommend if you are looking at making a generic client for a
certain API.

## Section Structure

Most sections will have code for you to work on as well as my solution to that
step (yours definitely does not need to look *exactly* the same!). These are
located in the `solution` directory for each section and can be run like all
sections with `cargo run` to see what the expected output is.

## Next Steps

Next I would navigate to the [contents] where you can get started!
